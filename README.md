## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently the lead programmer and designer for [HarvestProfit](https://www.harvestprofit.com).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the logistics of farm inventory and helping farmers across the world be more financially successful.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning surfing and gardening (mini farming haha).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on improving the use of geospatial formulas and reporting through ruby and graphql.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about design and UX questions, I've spent the last 10 years designing and building web applications to be simple yet powerful.
- ðŸ“« Ping me on X [@remotejake](https://x.com/remotejake)
- ðŸ§  My current opinion on developing modern applications is: **Smart API, Dumb Client** referencing the importance of more powerful APIs (GraphQL for the win!) and decreasing complexity on your front ends. Makes it easy to add features to multiple platforms, less bugs, and your partners will thank you too!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Kelly Slater is my favorite surfer primarily because if he can professionally surf at the grand ol age of 53 then I can do anything haha.


Cheers!
